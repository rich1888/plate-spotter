# plate-spotter: Raspberry Pi vehicle plate recognition system
#
# This file makes the "src/" directory a Python "package", which lets
# the modules inside (camera.py, detect.py, etc.) import each other
# using statements like:  from .config import load_config
#
# You don't need to put anything else in here.
